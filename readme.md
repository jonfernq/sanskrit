# Sanskrit

This fork of Oliver Hellwig's Digital Corpus of Sanskrit (DCS) repository aims to provide a collection of scripts 
in Python and Javascript to re-purpose the DCS for practical language learning activities. This includes various
forms of flashcards for learning vocabulary and grammar as well as re-formatting the DCS in an interlinear
translation format to facilitate the working out of difficult advanced Sanskrit texts such as by Kālidāsa's
Kumārasaṃbhavam (कुमारसम्भवम्) and and Bhāravi's Kirātārjunīya (किरातार्जुनीय) as read in the University of Hawai'i's 
Sanskrit seminar.  

The Javascript presentation microframework Reveal.js
is used to display worked out interlinear translations
with related grammatical and vocabulary flashcards.
The interlinear translations are worked out in plain 
flat files (.txt).
