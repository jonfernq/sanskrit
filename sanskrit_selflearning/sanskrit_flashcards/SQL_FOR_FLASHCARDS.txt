- Lexical info extracted and formatted into CSV for flashcard: 

SELECT SENTENCE_COMPOUND_WORD, '  ' || GRAMMAR || '  ' || WORD_CITATION ||  '  ' || meanings  from WordsAndMeanings WHERE TEXT_UNIT = 'W' AND SENTENCE_COMPOUND_WORD <> '_'


-- create_view_w_dict_meanings.sql

CREATE VIEW WordsAndMeanings AS
SELECT meghaduta1.TEXT_UNIT,meghaduta1.WORK,meghaduta1.CHAPTER,meghaduta1.VERSE,meghaduta1.HALF_VERSE,meghaduta1.WORD,meghaduta1.SENTENCE_COMPOUND_WORD,meghaduta1.WORD_CITATION,sktdictdcs3.meanings,meghaduta1.POS,meghaduta1.GRAMMAR
FROM meghaduta1
INNER JOIN sktdictdcs3 ON meghaduta1.TEXT_UNIT='W' AND meghaduta1.WORD_NUMBER=sktdictdcs3.id


- Select out info (or flashcards) for a range of stanzas 

SELECT * from WordsAndMeanings WHERE cast(VERSE AS INTEGER) > 30 AND cast(VERSE AS INTEGER) < 50 ORDER BY VERSE


- Filter out uninflected elements of compounds 

SELECT * from WordsAndMeanings WHERE TEXT_UNIT = 'W' AND SENTENCE_COMPOUND_WORD <> '_'


- Select all the elements needed for a flashcard 

SELECT WORD_CITATION, meanings  from WordsAndMeanings WHERE TEXT_UNIT = 'W' AND SENTENCE_COMPOUND_WORD <> '_'


- Select all the elements needed for a longer more involved flashcard 

SELECT SENTENCE_COMPOUND_WORD, GRAMMAR, WORD_CITATION, meanings  from WordsAndMeanings WHERE TEXT_UNIT = 'W' AND SENTENCE_COMPOUND_WORD <> '_'
